 🔹 What is Data?
Data is a collection of raw facts and figures that, when processed, provide meaningful information. In the context of databases and SQL, data refers to the values stored in tables.

🔹 How is Data Stored in SQL?
Data in SQL is organized in a relational database, which uses tables to store information.

⦁	Tables consist of rows and columns
⦁	A row (also called a record) represents a single entry
⦁	A column represents a data field or attribute
⦁	Each column has a specific data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE)

🔹 Example Table: Students

| ID	| Name	| Age	| Grade |
|  1	| Alice	| 20	|   A	|
|  2	| Bob	| 22	|   B	|

ID: Unique identifier (usually an integer)
Name: Student’s name (text)
Age: Student’s age (integer)
Grade: Letter grade (text)

🔹 Types of Data in SQL

| Data Type | Description          | Example      |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `INT`     | Integer number       | 25           |
| `VARCHAR` | Variable-length text | "Alice"      |
| `DATE`    | Date value           | 2025-08-10   |
| `BOOLEAN` | True or False value  | TRUE / FALSE |
| `FLOAT`   | Decimal number       | 3.14         |



🔹What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of related data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
It stores data in a structured format, usually in the form of tables, and allows users to perform operations such as insert, update, delete, and query the data.

🔹 Key Features of a Database
⦁	 Stores large amounts of data efficiently
⦁	 Supports easy data access and retrieval
⦁	 Maintains data accuracy and integrity
⦁	 Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously
⦁	 Offers security and backup features

🔹 Components of a Database:

| Component            | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
|   Tables             | Store data in rows and columns              |
|   Fields (Columns)   | Define the type of data stored              |
|   Records (Rows)     | Individual entries in the table             |
|   Keys               | Uniquely identify data (e.g., Primary Key)  |
|   Schema             | Structure that defines the database objects |

🔹 Example: Simple Students Database

| ID | Name  | Age | Grade |
| -- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice | 20  | A     |
| 2  | Bob   | 22  | B     |

🔹 Types of Databases :

| Type                   | Description                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
|   Relational (RDBMS)   | Data stored in tables; uses SQL                   |
|   NoSQL                | Non-tabular format (e.g., documents, key-value)   |
|   Cloud Databases      | Hosted online, scalable (e.g., AWS RDS, Firebase) |


🔹 What is DBMS?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps create, manage, and manipulate databases.
It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently while maintaining data integrity and security.

🔹 Examples of Database Software
⦁	MySQL
⦁	PostgreSQL
⦁	SQLite
⦁	Microsoft SQL Server
⦁	Oracle Database

🔹 Why DBMS?

⦁ Data Storage – Stores large volumes of data efficiently.
⦁ Data Abstraction – Hides the complexity of data storage from users.
⦁ Controls Data Redundancy – Minimizes duplicate data.
⦁ Multi-user Access and Views – Supports concurrent access with personalized views.
⦁ Security – Protects data through authentication and authorization.

🔹 Data Models

Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modelled.
They also define how data is connected to each other, how it is processed, and stored inside the system.

🔹Types of Data Models:

1.	Hierarchical Model
Organizes data in a tree-like structure.
Each record has a parent-child relationship.
2.	Network Model
Uses a graph structure with nodes (records) and edges (relationships).
Records can have multiple parent and child records.
3.	Entity Relationship (ER) Model
Uses entities (objects) and relationships to describe data.
Commonly used in database design before converting to a relational model.
4.	Relational Model
Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
Uses keys to establish relationships between tables.
5.	NoSQL Model
Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data.
   Types include document-based, key-value, column-oriented, and graph databases.

🔹SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is the standard language used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data in relational databases.

⦁	It is a database programming language used for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database.
⦁	All Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

🔹What SQL Does?

⦁	Create Databases & Tables – SQL can be used to create new databases and tables to store data.
⦁	Execute Queries – SQL can run queries against a database to fetch specific information.
⦁	Manage Data – SQL can retrieve, update, delete, and insert records into tables.
⦁	Create Stored Procedures & Views – SQL allows defining reusable queries and stored logic.
⦁	Set Permissions – SQL can grant or revoke access rights on tables, views, and procedures.

🔹SQL Constraints

SQL Constraints are rules applied to table columns to ensure the accuracy, validity, and reliability of the data stored in a database.
They control what kind of values can be inserted, updated, or deleted in a table, preventing invalid data entry.
-

| **HAVING**   | Filters grouped records based on a condition, used with `GROUP BY` (like `WHERE` for groups).| `SELECT customer, SUM(amount) FROM Sales GROUP BY customer 
																	HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;` 	       |

JOINS

A JOIN in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, usually a foreign key relationship.


Table: employees

| employee_id | name    | department_id |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------- |
| 1            | Alice   | 10             |
| 2            | Bob     | 20             |
| 3            | Charlie | 30             |
| 4            | David   | NULL           |

Table: departments

| department_id  | department_name  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 10             | HR               |
| 20             | Engineering      |
| 40             | Marketing        |

🔹 1. INNER JOIN

Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.


Query:

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

🔸 Result:

| name  | department_name  |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Alice | HR               |
| Bob   | Engineering      |

🔹 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the left table (employees), and matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, NULL is returned for the right table's columns.

Query:

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

🔸 Result:

| name    | department_name  |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Alice   | HR               |
| Bob     | Engineering      |
| Charlie | NULL             |
| David   | NULL             |

🔹 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the right table (departments), and matched rows from the left table. If no match, NULL on the left.

Query:

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

🔸 Result:

| name  | department_name  |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Alice | HR               |
| Bob   | Engineering      |
| NULL  | Marketing        |

🔹 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Rows without a match get NULLs for the missing side.

Query : 

SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

🔸 Result:

| name    | department_name  |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Alice   | HR               |
| Bob     | Engineering      |
| Charlie | NULL             |
| David   | NULL             |
| NULL    | Marketing        |

| Type of Join    | Returns                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| INNER JOIN      | Only matched rows from both tables                          |
| LEFT JOIN       | All from left table + matched from right (NULL if no match) |
| RIGHT JOIN      | All from right table + matched from left (NULL if no match) |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | All rows from both tables (NULLs where no match)            |
| CROSS JOIN      | All combinations (Cartesian product)                        |
